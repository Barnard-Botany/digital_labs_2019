# Global Power of Botany 
This course will include a series of digital labs, and two big portions of your grade will come from (1) completing your Digital Portfolios and (2) projects that will require digital skills. Our first digital lab is not until Week 3, but you should get started earlier. Why is this important?
 
First, if you can get early assignments done, you'll be ahead and you'll be confident and productive during the first digital lab and beyond.
 
Second, there are several assignments for the Digital Portfolios that you should do early, and even though some are entirely or mostly browser-based, you will find it's necessary to have R and RStudio to format them for the portfolios.

It is easy to do on PC or Mac. I estimate that you can do the installation and do some post-installation exploring in about 40 minutes time.

## Getting Started with...

### R
Install R from https://cran.r-project.org/
Download RStudio Desktop (FREE) from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

Everyone in the class should know about [lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/). Because you've paid tuition, you have access to it and you'll just need to sign up (using your UNI) and sign in (if you weren't a student, fees would be required).

If you're having trouble downloading R or RStudio, go to lynda.com, navigate to "R Statistics Essential Training" and follow the first three tutorials:
(1) Install R on your computer. Video is 3:19; at most you need 5 minutes to install R.
(2) Then install RStudio. Video is 4:36; you may need 10 minutes to get this big program in.
(3) Lastly, it would be a good idea to view and do "Taking a first look at the interface" - 10-20 minutes.

There are an overwhelming number of online tutorials for people new to the R programming language. If you have the time and are interested, go [here](https://erc.barnard.edu/sites/default/files/erc_faculty_workshop_session_1_2.pdf) or [here](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) for more of the basics.

Alternatively, type these commands in your RStudio console:

> install.packages(“swirl”)

> library(swirl)

and explore these tutorials within RStudio.

For a more in depth introduction to RStudio than lynda.com offers, go [here](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1). Whether or not you’re new to RStudio, this guide gives you a great sense of the shortcuts and options you have to help with your assignments. If you already have R and RStudio, it's a good idea to update your packages.

### GitHub

Creating readable code and collaborating with others is an important programming skill. GitHub is a popular, free, open-source site that helps you keep track of different versions of files and share them with collaborators (fellow students, colleagues, etc). You will need to create a GitHub account for this class as most coding assignments will be submitted in this way.

Go to https://github.com/ to create a new account
Select the “Unlimited public repositories for free” option and skip any surveys
Complete the GitHub start guide; you should receive a prompt for this after signing up, but in case you don’t see it, go here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
Finally, for a relatively quick and comprehensive tutorial about git (the program GitHub is based on), go to https://try.github.io/, click on “Git-It”, and follow the instructions. If you scroll all the way up on the “Git-It” page, you’ll see that it is itself a file in a git repository stored on GitHub! Hopefully this will give you an idea of what GitHub is used for/capable of doing.

If you’re interested in learning more about git and GitHub, read the online Git Pro book or go to https://guides.github.com/.

### Markdown

Markdown is a simple text editor language that we will use to format our code-based assignments in this class. For a simple introduction, follow this short tutorial:
https://www.markdowntutorial.com/

For a good side-by-side (markdown → code) view, practice here: https://stackedit.io/app#

If any of this is confusing/intimidating, that’s completely normal. Programming has a steep learning curve. Be patient with yourself, stick with it, and know that we’re available and happy to help.
